Welcome to AERtronic Lite Documentation!
========================================================

This project presents a comprehensive solution for the current AERtronic Advanced in LATAM. The primary objective is to develop a new and improved MCU to replace the existing module, dedicated to displaying precise readings from pressure and temperature sensors.

To achieve this, we are embarking on the development of a sophisticated interface from the ground up, utilizing an 800x480px Nextion Display. Leveraging the powerful Nextion editor and the Arduino platform, we will meticulously replicate the core functionality of the AERtronic Advanced at its fundamental level.

Our team of skilled professionals will employ cutting-edge techniques and innovative approaches to ensure the seamless integration of the new MCU and interface, providing a user experience that surpasses the current system's capabilities. By diligently adhering to industry best practices and stringent quality standards, we are committed to delivering a remarkable product that exceeds expectations and sets new benchmarks for excellence in the fie
