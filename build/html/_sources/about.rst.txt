AERtronic Lite is an innovative project aimed at modernizing and enhancing traditional analog indicator systems by replacing them with a cutting-edge 7-inch display, powered by an ESP32 microcontroller unit (MCU). This system offers a seamless and cost-effective solution to upgrade various monitoring and control applications in the wastewater sector.

With AERtronic Lite, users can transform their outdated analog indicators into a visually engaging and dynamic digital interface, providing real-time data visualization and interactive functionalities. The ESP32 MCU serves as the core of the system, offering reliable processing power and connectivity options, making it ideal for IoT applications.

The 7-inch display offers a user-friendly interface, presenting information in an intuitive and customizable manner. It allows users to easily switch between different data sets and adjust settings to meet specific requirements. The display's high resolution ensures clear and crisp visuals, enhancing the overall user experience.

By eliminating the limitations of analog indicators and embracing the capabilities of digital technology, AERtronic Lite empowers users with greater control, efficiency, and data insights, revolutionizing the way they interact with their systems and making it easier to adapt to evolving needs.
