Installation
------------

To set up the AERtronic Lite system, follow the steps below:

1. **Hardware Assembly**:
   - Gather all the necessary components, including the ESP32 MCU, Nextion display, and required electronic components.
   - Assemble the hardware components according to the provided schematic or circuit diagram using Proteus software for reference.

2. **Upload Firmware**:
   - Connect the ESP32 MCU to your computer using a USB cable.
   - Open the Arduino IDE and load the AERtronic Lite firmware source code.
   - Compile the code and upload it to the ESP32 MCU.

3. **Nextion Display Configuration**:
   - Use the Nextion Editor software to design the graphical user interface (GUI) for the Nextion display.
   - Write the necessary ASCII commands in the Nextion Editor to enable data visualization and user interactions.
   - Save the configuration and transfer it to the Nextion display.

4. **Power On and Test**:
   - Power on the AERtronic Lite system, ensuring all connections are secure.
   - The Nextion display should now show the interface you designed, and the ESP32 MCU should be ready to process data.

5. **Connectivity Setup (Optional)**:
   - If the AERtronic Lite system requires communication with external devices or networks, configure the ESP32 libraries accordingly.
   - Set up any additional communication protocols, such as Wi-Fi or Bluetooth, as needed.

6. **Final Testing**:
   - Test the entire system thoroughly to ensure all functionalities work as expected.
   - Verify the accuracy of data visualization and responsiveness of user interactions.

7. **Mounting and Integration**:
   - Once the AERtronic Lite system is fully tested and operational, mount the components securely in their intended application environment.
   - Ensure the system is integrated correctly with the monitored devices or control systems.

Congratulations! The AERtronic Lite system is now successfully installed and ready to provide a modern and efficient digital interface for monitoring and controlling your applications.
